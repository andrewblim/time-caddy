Hello,

Someone has requested a password reset for your account. Hopefully it was you! If it wasn't you, please notify <%= "#{settings.support_email}" %> and disregard the rest of this email.

If you did request this password reset, your confirmation code is

<%= "#{@password_reset_token}\n" %>

To reset your password, please visit the following page and enter the confirmation code along with your desired new password:

<%= "#{build_url(request, "/password_reset?url_token=#{@password_reset_url_token}")}\n" %>

Thanks,
time-caddy
