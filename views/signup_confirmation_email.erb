Hello <%= @new_user.username %>,

You or someone with your email address has tried to sign up for a time-caddy account. We require email confirmation before activating your account, so that we can be sure it's really you. Your confirmation code is

<%= "#{@signup_confirmation_token}\n" %>

Please enter the code on the confirmation page that you are already on. In case you've navigated away, it's

<%= "#{URI.join(base_url, "/signup_confirmation?token=#{@signup_confirmation_url_token}")}\n" %>

Thanks,
time-caddy
