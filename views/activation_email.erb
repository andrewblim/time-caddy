Hello <%= @activation_user.username %>,

You or someone with your email address has tried to sign up for a time-caddy account. We require email confirmation before activating your account, so that we can be sure it's really you. Your confirmation code is

<%= "#{@activation_token}\n" %>

Please enter the code on the confirmation page that you are already on. In case you've navigated away, it's

<%= "#{request.url}\n" %>

This account activation code supersedes any others that you have already received.

Thanks,
time-caddy
