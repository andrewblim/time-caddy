Hello <%= @password_reset_user.username %>,

You or someone with your username or email address has tried to reset your password. We require email confirmation before permitting a reset, so that we can be sure it's really you. Your confirmation code is

<%= "#{@password_reset_token}\n" %>

Please enter the code on the confirmation page that you are already on. In case you've navigated away, it's

<%= "#{URI.join(base_url, "/password_reset")}\n" %>

This password reset request code will expire after a period of time, in which case you will have to request a new one at

<%= "#{URI.join(base_url, "/password_reset_request")}\n" %>

Thanks,
time-caddy
