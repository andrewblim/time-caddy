Hello <%= %>

You or someone with your email address has tried to sign up for a time-caddy account. We require email confirmation before your account becomes active, to make sure it's really you. Your confirmation code is

<%= @activation_token %>

Please enter the code on the confirmation page that you are already on. If you've navigated away, it's

<%= request.url %>

This account activation code supersedes any others that you have already received. 

Thanks,
time-caddy
