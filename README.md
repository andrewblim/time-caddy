# time-caddy

time-caddy is a time-tracking app. Its goals are:

- Make entry as easy as possible. Type in a box, hit enter, and the app will parse things for you.
- Produce simple, elegant reports on how you've spent your time.
- Provide a way to create plans for periods of time and subsequently review how those plans panned out.
- Don't do too much else. This is not, by design:
  - a project management system
  - a billable-hours system
  - a time card system

The app's focus will always be to help users *understand* how their time is spent so that they can plan better in the future.
